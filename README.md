# What are users eating? A study of the most popular food.com recipes
Food.com is looking to have more diverse cuisine types within the recipes that they offer on their site. They have started to get an overwhelming majority of recipes for a few select cuisine types because these recipes have had the highest user interactions thus far. But what are the more specific factors that are giving these recipes high interaction? Is it only the cuisine type or could it be something else? The goal for this research is to find a significant correlation between the recipe attributes and user interaction and ratings. Finding the factors that contribute to user satisfaction with recipes outside of cuisine type can help us find recipes that have these specific attributes within different types of cuisine.

## 1. Data
To examine this question, we will use a dataset that consists of food.com recipes. This dataset includes information about the amount of time, nutritional facts, steps, ingredients, as well as the recipe contributor. It also includes user ratings and interactions (comments) about the recipes. The stakeholders for this project are the content manager for the site as well as the recipe addition and retention manager and team.
